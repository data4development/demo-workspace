This repository offers a demonstration workspace to use with
https://github.com/data4development/iati-workbench[the iati-workbench engine.]

== Demo organisation

The org-id.guide project has reserved http://org-id.guide/list/XE-EXAMPLE[the prefix `XE-EXAMPLE`^] to use in example data,
for instance for validation purposes.

We use `XE-EXAMPLE-AIDA` as organisation identifier in the demo workspace.
